# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe application built during the
[React Tutorial][].

No extra bits of functionality were added, but I did change some of the code
around so that it made more sense to me, added [ESLint][], and made things a
bit more strongly typed with [Typescript][].

It's deployed out using Github Pages at
<https://paulfioravanti.com/tic-tac-toe/>.

[ESLint]: https://eslint.org/
[React Tutorial]: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
[Typescript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
